## Abstract
Many digital platforms give users a bundle of goods sourced from numerous creators, generate revenue through consumption of these goods, and motivate creators by sharing of revenue. 
This paper studies the platform’s design choices and creators’ participation and supply decisions, when users’ (viewers’) consumption of goods (content) is financed by third-party advertisers. 
The model specifies the platform’s scale: number of creators and content supplied, and magnitudes of viewers, advertisers, and revenues. I examine how the distribution of creator capabilities affects market concentration among creators, and how it can be influenced by platform design. 
Tools for ad management and analytics will be more impactful when the platform has sufficient content and viewers but has low ad demand.
Conversely, reducing viewers’ distaste for ads through better matching and timing—which can create win-win-win effects throughout the ecosystem—is important when the platform has strong demand from advertisers. 
Platform infrastructure improvements that motivate creators to supply more content (e.g., development toolkits) must be chosen carefully to avoid creating higher concentration among a few powerful creators. 
Investments in first-party content are most consequential when the platform scale is small and when it has greater urgency to attract more viewers. 
I show that revenue-sharing is (only partly) a tug of war between the platform and creators, because a moderate sharing formula will strengthen the overall ecosystem and profits of all participants. 
However, revenue-sharing tensions indicate a need to extend the one- rate-for-all creators approach with richer revenue-sharing arrangements that can better accommodate heterogeneity among creators

## Introduction
Platforms that provide technology infrastructure to enable and coordinate interactions among multiple groups of participants are dominating business and social activity today (Parker et al., 2016). 
This paper discusses the economic interplay in multi-sided platforms that connect contributors (or creators or developers), viewers (or consumers) and advertisers. 
Several large platforms attract hundreds of millions of viewers with “goods” (or content, such as music, movies, games, TV shows, blogs, recipes, how-to videos, apps, etc.) that are sourced from thousands of creators and whose consumption is financed by advertising payments.
Such platforms are booming in categories such as music, video entertainment, virtual sports, and casual gaming, and are the dominant model in many countries (Westcott, 2020). 
Examples include Snap Games, Twitch, Jinri Toutiao, Facebook’s in-stream videos, Pandora (free version), Plex, Amazon’s IMDb TV, Comcast’s Peacock, Pluto TV, Xumo, Hulu, Crackle/Sony, The Roku Channel, and broadcast TV. 

Viewers see a bundle of content and care about bundle scale and variety; the presence of viewers attracts advertisers; and the platform shares its ad revenue spoils with creators to motivate their participation and supply. 
Even in platforms that feature user-generated content such as TikTok, Instagram or YouTube, a substantial part of consumer traffic is driven by content from stars, celebrities, and other popular figures, such as the 9-year old Ryan Kaji whose toy-box-opening videos made him the #1 YouTube star in 2019 and 2020.1 Conversely, these star creators are the dominant recipients of advertising revenues from the platform, thus rendering a three-sided platform comprising viewers, creators, and advertisers.
This paper develops a model to structure and analyze this kind of enterprise, and examines the following questions. 
How do the economic characteristics of these three groups (creators, viewers, and advertisers) determine the overall scale of such platform, including the magnitude of content supplied by creators, demand generated by the platform, and the level of advertising featured on it? 
How is this supply distributed amongst creators, and what is the likely level of fragmentation or concentration in the creator ecosystem?
And, how should these outcomes influence the platform’s approach to internal investments and design decisions related to creator ecosystem management, level of advertising, and revenue sharing with creators? 
The analysis pertains to platforms that are free to consumers, which monetize their value through advertising rather than consumer fees, and where the share of advertising revenue is creators’ primary motive to offer their outputs through the platform.

Figure 1: Stylized view of an advertising-driven 3-sided platform. The platform exhibits content sourced from creators to consumers, displays ads against these views, and shares advertising revenues with creators to motivate them to supply content and to increase consumer visits.

Fig. 1 depicts the elements of the model. Creators collectively supply an amount Q of content to the platform, with creator j’s output labeled as Qj (and Q= Pj Qj ). 
Creators vary in their ability to generate views and attract advertising, and this heterogeneity is captured by a unit creation cost cj (> 0) for generating a unit view. 
Consumers are attracted by content and collectively generate V views, with V increasing in Q (but at diminishing rate) and decreasing in the level of advertising A chosen by the platform. 
The platform may also have first-party content Q0, including content purchased or licensed directly and not subject to revenue sharing, which creates intrinsic value and generates α0 views. 
Advertisers are attracted by the platform’s potential to reach customers, and the aggregate demand from advertisers when the platform charges a per-view price p is written as A(p). The platform earns advertising revenue R = p · A and returns a fraction γ to creators with each creator receiving a share proportional to their contribution. 
Creator j’s output Q∗j is chosen to maximize its payoff, its share of ad revenue net costs of content. 

The primary levers of control for the platform are (i) the advertising level A (conversely, the per-view price p), (ii) the revenue-sharing parameter γ and intrinsic value α0 (or, first-party content Q0), and (iii) additional platform design variables that impact the exogenous parameters in the model (e.g., β, δ, φ that affect price sensitivity
of advertiser demand, viewer sensitivity to ads, and sensitivity of ad demand to the quantity and variety of content). 
The revenue-sharing rate is considered identical across all contributors (Oh et al., 2015). This is common in real-world platforms which, despite pressures and incentives to set heterogeneous sharing rates, avoid doing so to prevent a floodgate of negotiations around revenue-sharing, or to avoid the expense of negotiating with thousands of contributors to a large bundle (Shiller and Waldfogel, 2013).
A few recent papers have examined content production and revenue-sharing in multi-sided content platforms. Topics analyzed include whether platforms should pursue consumer fees or advertising or both (Amaldoss et al., 2021), creators’ behavior under monetary and altruistic motivations (Tang et al., 2012), market power and industry structure (Evans, 2008), monetization models (Peitz and Valletti, 2008; Calvano and Polo, 2020), marketing allocations to the consumer and advertiser sides (Sridhar et al., 2011), the balancing of advertising and content (Dewan et al., 2002; Godes et al., 2009; Amaldoss et al., 2021), and the impact of creator-competition and consumer characteristics on the revenue-sharing incentives of the platform and creators (Jain and Qian, 2021). 
Relative to these papers, a key contribution of the present paper is to incorporate the decision making and preferences of the platform, its creators, and advertisers (with viewers addressed through an aggregate demand function) into a coherent framework, and to link the outcomes in this three-sided dance to platform design elements and the revenue-sharing arrangement. 
The modeling framework embeds a richer treatment of an ecosystem of heterogeneous creators, endogenizing both their participation in the platform and level of output, while capturing both co-dependence with the platform (creating revenue by bringing viewers and advertisers into the system) and competition against the platform and within creators (all vying for a share of revenue). 

With this framework, the paper shows how the incentives and behavior of the advertiser side moderate the revenue-sharing tension between the platform and creators; it explains how the predicted participant behavior and economic outcomes can guide platform design; and it studies the interaction between revenue-sharing rules and ecosystem performance along multiple metrics.
The application of this framework generates several insightful results. 
First, it provides a way to identify likely platform scale along multiple metrics, the content it would receive from creators, what set of creators would supply content, and the level of advertising and ad revenues that the platform would generate (§3.1).

Second, it offers insights on alternate ways in which the platform can alter its design to influence creators’ actions and platform scale (§3.2). 
Platforms have multiple levers for influencing different parts of the ecosystem, and need to deploy them astutely. 
For instance, a platform which has strong viewership may prioritize tools for ad management and partnerships to pull in advertisers (e.g., Facebook). 
Other platforms that need more content to bring in viewers might prioritize creator support tools (e.g., Snap and Instagram), or build media partnerships for more content (e.g., Toutiao). 
Marketing to attract more viewers may be called for when the platform sees strong demand from advertisers but lacks viewers. I show that interventions like development toolkits and creator support programs will best promote the platform’s interest if they are easy to absorb by all creators and level the playing field among them, thereby making creators more homogeneous and competitive. 
However, if such interventions involve a steep learning curve or significant adoption costs,
then they might well amplify differences among creators, which leads to greater concentration in content supply.
Third, I study the manner in which the revenue-sharing tension between creators and the platform intersects with the platform’s control over advertising policy (§4). 
Although creators in general would desire higher revenue share γ (i.e., a greater percentage of ad revenues), this desire is moderated by the knowledge that high γ would force the platform to raise ad prices, thus lowering the amount of advertising and hence hurt their own advertising revenue share (§4.1). 
Conversely, the platform is deterred from setting γ too low for that would reduce the contributions of creators and cripple the basic content fuel of the ecosystem.
The paper provides a foundation for analysis of a range of issues in such 3-sided platforms, including those related to platform competition, market power, industry concentration, and anti-competitive practices.
